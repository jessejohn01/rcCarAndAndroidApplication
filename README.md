# Custom RC Car
This was a custom RC Car that was created as an interdisciplinary project my junior year of college.
I was tasked with handling the circuitry and the android application to control the car. I designed a
circuit board and had the board printed to handle all the connections. The rc car runs off C and the
android application runs on java. The android application communicates over a bluetooth connection to
the rc car's bluetooth receiver.
